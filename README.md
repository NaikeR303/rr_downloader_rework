This is a rework of one of my previous projects, Royal Road archiver

It can generate wide variety of filetypes (PDF, TXT, HTML, EPUB and so on (list will expand)) in many different themes (Light, Dark, Antique, Midnight and so on (like filetypes, it will expand))

And ALL IN UI with IT'S OWN EXECUTABLES

So, if you're interested, star it. Because I will work on it in the future at least untill it works
